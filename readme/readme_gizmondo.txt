Potator for Gizmondo (Pre-release)
==============================

Here's potator,  a Watara Supervision emulator, now ported to Gizmondo.
However, i have no idea if this works well because i currently don't own one as of now.
In fact, it is possible that the controls do not work very well or at all.
All the games are playable as far as i know.

Here's some Supervision i recommend to check out :
- Jaguar Bomber : Good looking shoot em up thingy.
- Chimera : Cool isometric game but i don't get it. (Choose rotational for controls at the titlescreen)
- Balloon Fight : Clone of Ballon fight of the same name.

===========
Use Potator
===========

You really should use Firefly's Launcher to launch it, don't waste your time with WCE.
It can be found here :

=============================
Instructions for Firefly's Launcher 
=============================

Firefly's Launcher allows you to play all the emulators without having to run WindowsCE mode. 
Simply place the autorun from the Firefly folder onto the root of your SD card. 
A few emulators such as SquidgEngine will not work with Firefly's launcher. 
A way around this is to rename them to SquidgEngine.exe and place them on the root of the SD card alongside a generic autorun file. 
In this case, make sure to rename Firefly's Launcher to something other than autorun.

Updating Your Gizmondo to Service Pack B: 
1. Place autorun.exe and install.bin onto the root of your SD card 
2. Run autorun.exe from the Games Directory

Entering Windows CE on your Gizmondo 
1. Place files from LockNLoad folder onto the root of your SD card (leave WinCE as a folder) 
2. run autorun.exe in Games Directory
