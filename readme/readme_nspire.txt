Potator for TI Nspire (CX)
--------------------------------------------

Here's potator,  a Watara Supervision emulator for Ti Nspire (CX).
Since i've switched from libSDL to n2DLib, everything is twice as fast !
Now the underclocked version beats the overcloked SDL version !

It runs fullspeed when overcloked to 224Mhz.
It runs at 45FPS when not overclocked.
All the games are playable as far as i know.

Here's some Supervision i recommend to check out :
- Jaguar Bomber : Good looking shoot em up thingy.
- Chimera : Cool isometric game but i don't get it. (Choose rotational for controls at the titlescreen)
- Balloon Fight : Clone of Ballon fight of the same name.
